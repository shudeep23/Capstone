# The dataset was obtained from a longitudual study of children of immigrants in San Diego, CA  and Ft. Lauderdale/Miami, Fl. The dataset consists of an initial survey of children during 8th or 9th grade. A follow-up survey was conducted during high-school. And the last survey was done around 10 years after the initial survey. The dataset consists of demographic data, in addition to ordinal measures for a variety of attitudes and attributes. These include family composition and cohesion, perception of discrimination, socio-economic indicators. The survey also includes a parental questionnaire. I only included observations which had all survey components, three from the child and one from the parent.  I develop two distinct models to predict college completion. One is logistic regression and the other is random forest. The models exhibit similar performance in terms of precision and recall but utilize different variables.
